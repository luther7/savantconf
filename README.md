# savantconf

A small script to configure the keybindings of a Kinesis Savant Elite triple
foot pedal  

This is for the _first version_ of the Savant - if you have the second version
you do not need this script.  

By default, the pedals will send three scan codes for a three key combination.
All three pedals send the same two scancodes for the first two and a unique one
for the final. The first two mappings in the script account for this by
mapping the first two scancodes to the unknown key.
